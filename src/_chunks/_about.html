Groupletter allows groups to start a newsletter. The group fills the newsletter by adding links to the backlog and by voting on links already on the backlog. The more votes a link gets the higher the chances that the link ends up in the newsletter (configurable). This keeps the quality of the newsletter high.

Subscribers get the best links curated by the group every week (configurable). Imagine a groupletter from a bunch of successful entrepreneurs, designers or developers. Wouldn't that be nice?
